# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
## Author
Abdelrahman – I started coding in 2021, learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I decided to go back to the basics, so I am currently learning C++, OOP, and problem-solving.
A simple console-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game built in C++. The player competes against the computer across multiple rounds, and the game displays the winner of each round as well as the final result.
## How to Run
1. Compile the code: `g++ main.cpp -o game`
2. Run the executable: `./game`
